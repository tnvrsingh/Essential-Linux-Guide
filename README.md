# Essential-Linux-Guide
An android app and guide on Github to help beginners learn, use and adopt Linux as a daily driver. This guide/app will also help students/developers set up their development environment in Linux with minimal effort.

# Description
I've seen a lot of people who are scared of Linux, specifically the terminal thinking its some scary thing. Its the most important tool. Learning to be productive with the terminal and doing some automation - is all about being productive.

**NOTE: This guide will push you do minimal (and easy but essential) research along the way. Its important. It might be challenging to find stuff but it will help you in the long run.**

# Where do I start?
The guide is available in the following locations: 

1. [The Wiki](https://github.com/tnvrsingh/Essential-Linux-Guide/wiki)

2. Essential Linux Guide Play Store Link (As soon as the app is finished)

# Installation 

Google Play Store here soon as soon as the app is live. Till then read the wiki here: 
https://github.com/tnvrsingh/Essential-Linux-Guide/wiki


# Usage
Please use the app or wiki as a reference. Learning is all about doing and you won't make progress unless you take the plunge and start working actively with Linux.

The guide is in the initial stages of writing at this in time and I'm taking my time to make it approachable. Stay tuned!
