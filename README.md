# Essential-Linux-Guide
An android app and guide on Github to help beginners learn, use and adopt Linux as a daily driver. This guide/app will also help developers set up their development environement with minimal effort.

# Description
I've seen a lot of people who are scared of Linux, specifically the terminal thinking its some scary thing when its the most important tool here. Learning to be productive with the terminal and doing some automation - is all about being productive.

NOTE: This guide will push you do minimal (and easy but essential) research along the way. Its important. It might be challenging to find stuff but will help you in the long run. 

** I'll post some cool things people have done with Linux and some basic bash scripting here **

# Installation 

** Google Play Store here soon as soon as the app is live

# Usage
Please use the app as a reference. Learning is all about doing and you won't make progress unless you take the plunge and start working actively with Linux.



Initial stages of writing at this in time. Stay tuned!
